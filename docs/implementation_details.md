# ADAS System Implementation Details

## System Architecture

The ADAS system is implemented as a modular architecture with the following main components:

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Camera Processor: Handles image preprocessing, normalization, and format conversion
   - Radar Processor: Processes radar data, including signal processing and noise reduction

2. **Object Detection**
   - Object Detector: Uses YOLOv8 for camera-based object detection
   - Road Detector: Implements lane detection, road boundary detection, and traffic sign recognition

3. **Sensor Fusion**
   - Fuses data from multiple sensors (camera, radar)
   - Implements coordinate transformation and data correlation
   - Provides unified object tracking

4. **Collision Avoidance**
   - Risk assessment based on multiple factors
   - Lane deviation detection
   - Traffic sign compliance
   - Road boundary monitoring

5. **Visualization**
   - Real-time display of system outputs
   - Warning system
   - Status information

## Implementation Details

### 1. Object Detection

#### Camera-based Detection
- Uses YOLOv8 model for object detection
- Processes images at 30 FPS
- Detects multiple object classes (person, car, truck)
- Confidence threshold: 0.1
- Output includes bounding boxes, class names, and confidence scores

#### Road Infrastructure Detection
- Lane Detection:
  - Uses Canny edge detection
  - Hough transform for line detection
  - Region of interest filtering
  - Line averaging for stable detection

- Road Boundary Detection:
  - Edge detection and contour finding
  - Area-based filtering
  - Contour approximation

- Traffic Sign Detection:
  - Color-based segmentation (HSV color space)
  - Shape analysis
  - Size and aspect ratio filtering

### 2. Sensor Fusion

#### Data Correlation
- Matches objects between sensors based on:
  - Spatial proximity
  - Velocity consistency
  - Class agreement

#### Coordinate Transformation
- Camera to world coordinates
- Radar to camera alignment
- Time synchronization

### 3. Collision Avoidance

#### Risk Assessment
- Multiple risk factors:
  - Distance to objects
  - Relative velocity
  - Time to collision
  - Lane deviation
  - Traffic sign compliance
  - Road boundary proximity

#### Warning System
- Risk level calculation (0.0 to 1.0)
- Warning messages for different scenarios
- Color-coded risk indicators

### 4. Visualization

#### Display Elements
- Object bounding boxes with labels
- Lane lines and road boundaries
- Traffic signs
- Risk level indicator
- Warning messages

#### Color Coding
- Green: Low risk
- Yellow: Medium risk
- Orange: High risk
- Red: Critical risk
